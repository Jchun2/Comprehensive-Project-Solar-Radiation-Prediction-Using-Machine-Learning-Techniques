# Comprehensive-Project-Solar-Radiation-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This project focuses on predicting Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), a key measure of solar radiation, using machine learning techniques. The aim was to evaluate and compare the performance of three models: linear regression, decision tree regression, and a stacking regressor.
